/// Nimble libary is a collection of C++ classes for 2D/3D graphics.

/** Nimble is used mostly for simple arithmetic/geometric
    calculations. The code is optimized for performance, thus there
    are a lot of inline functions. Also, the vector and matrix classes
    <b>do not</b> initialize any of their members.

    The matrix and vector classes use right-handed coordinates.

    \b Copyright: The Nimble library has been developed by Helsinki
    University of Technology, Telecommunications Software and
    Multimedia Laboratory in the Digital Interactive Virtual Acoustics
    (DIVA, 1999-2005, as part of the Fluid interaction framework). It
    has been developed further by Helsinki Institute for Information
    Technology (HIIT, 2006-2007) and MultiTouch Oy (2007-2008).
